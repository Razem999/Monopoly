Deliverables Milestone 1:
  - UML Diagram: This is a UML class diagram that shows the relationships between alls classes as well as each classes
  methods and variables. This was worked on by all group members at the start of the project to determine all needed methods
  and variables, then was edited when code was done to adjust for any changes made during the coding.
  
  - Sequence Diagrams (All sequence diagrams worked on as a group):
    - gameLogic.Player Rolls and Changes Turn: This diagram show the sequence of events that happen when a player rolls the dice and ends thier turn.
    - Print gameLogic.Player Status: This diagram shows the sequence of events that happen when a player requests that the game sidplay their status in the console.
    - Buy Property: This diagram shows the sequence of events that happen when the player succefully requests to buy an unowned property and when the purchase was successful.
    - paying Rent: This diagram shows the sequence of events that happen when a player lands on a tile that is owned by another player and has to pay rent to that player.
    - Bankruptcy: This diagram shows the sequence of events that happen when a player does not have enough money to pay an expence and the resulting bankruptcy meaning loss of           properties and removal from the game.
    
  - JAR File: This contains our projects code and documentation. Most files where made and edited by all members. See github contributions for 
    every addition from each member.
    
  - Documentation: All documentation can be found in the code above their respective functions and classes.
 
Known Issues:
  - None

Changes From Milestone 1 to Milestone 2:
  - First major difference is that we moved all the files into 3 seperate packages to help organize the code base
  - The next major change is the addition of the games user interface allowing them to see the board and click buttons for more interactive gameplay. This UI consists of 4           buttons being roll, pass, auction, and buy. It has a text box that explains to the user the events that have occured. It has a section dedicated to the status of the player     who's turn it currently is. Finally our UI has a map with the monopoly game tiles and player icons that move around the map when rolling the dice.
  - We adjusted our UML diagram to match the new set up and we also simplified the UML diagram to make it easier to understand.
  - Adding an engineering decisions document.

Deliverables Milestone 2:
  - UML Diagram: This is a UML class diagram has been simplified and now also shows new components of the UI and their relationships to the other classes.
    
  - JAR File: This contains our projects code and Java documentation.
    
  - Documentation: All documentation can be found in the code above their respective functions and classes.

  - Engineering Decisions: Explains why the code was developed the way it was.
 
Known Issues:
  - None
